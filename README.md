# This is a note app, developed on Vanilla JS (ES 5)

# What I have done:
- Implement the cart logic, load products and add / remove buttons (left side)
- Add the presentation logic to update "Order summary" subsection whenever a product is added or removed (right site).
- Only Vanilla JS (ES5 & ES6) is allowed is this exercise from JS perspective.
- Feel free to use tooling (Task runners, unit test, linters or css pre-processors).
- Follow the design as much as you can. Feel free to download the images that you consider.
(Optional) Write tests.
- Include a README file describing the component, your decisions, and any other useful information.
- Make your solution available on Github

# Discounts & Promotions:

- Implement these products discounts that will be applied automatically under some conditions:
- 2-for-1 promotions: buy two of the same product, get one free, applied to GOKU items.
bulk discounts: buying X or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced, applied to NARU items. P.e. if you buy 3 or more NARU items, the price per unit should be $19.00.
